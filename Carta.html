            <h4>Subjects of study </h4>
            At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility – as long as the busjects fall somewherein the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcheer, and just the kind of person we’d like to
            have on our team. Sayind that, f the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority
            <ol>
                <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
                <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30ºC (86ºF), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
                <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
            </ol>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <p> So please can you provide more information on each of this subjects, including how long you’d expect the research to take, required staff and other resourses, and anything else you think we’d need to know? Thanks.</p>

            <h4>Exotic dance moves </h4>
            <p> Yes, you are right! as part of my post- doctorate work. I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <br>
        <p style="margin:-2.0% 0;">Polynesian chicken dance </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p> A Little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around ina circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be “friutfull”.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style="margin:-1.5% 0;">Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p> Before the Icelanders developed fire as means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably tiny, very rapid movements.One
                of my fellow students used to say tha he thought this dance inspired modern styles such a twerking.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style="margin:-1.0% 0;">Arctic robot dance</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by “robotic”, styled movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later
                on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because thy were really cold.</p>
